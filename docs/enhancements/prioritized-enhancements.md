# Backlog Enhancement Prioritization (Flow & Durable Power Aligned)

**Objective**  
Embed the system into decision flow, regulatory comfort, and executive routines *before* expanding feature surface. Prioritize trust, interpretability, and unavoidable usage over sophistication.

---

## Phase 1 — Flow Lock-In (0–6 weeks)
*Make the system unavoidable for status, ownership, and decisions.*

1. **Immutable Change Log**
   - Capture who/when/old→new for status, ownership, phase
   - Foundation for audit trust and dispute resolution

2. **Ownership Surfacing (Inline Everywhere)**
   - Show Sponsor / Solution Owner / Component Owner on all views
   - Filter by owner to answer “who owns this?” instantly

3. **Blockers / Risks Callout + “Needs Attention”**
   - Lightweight blocker fields (owner, ETA)
   - Dashboard surfacing for immediate escalation

4. **One-Click Exec Summary Export**
   - PDF/PPT-ready snapshot with RAG, owners, blockers, next decisions
   - Locks distribution and eliminates shadow decks

---

## Phase 2 — Governance Gravity (6–12 weeks)
*Turn usage into institutional reliance.*

5. **CSV / Excel Import-Export Polish**
   - Prevalidated templates, import preview with errors
   - Lowers friction for cross-Treasury onboarding

6. **Conservative Auto-RAG (Project / Solution)**
   - Default Amber; editable with reason text
   - Exec-legible signal without false precision

7. **Owner Dashboards**
   - Owner-centric view of projects, blockers, approvals pending
   - Drives daily habit formation

8. **Dependency Visibility (“Blocked by”)**
   - Simple dependency tags with overdue warnings
   - Surfaces second-order risk and interaction failures

---

## Phase 3 — Control Without Bureaucracy (12–20 weeks)
*Add just enough process to satisfy governance—no more.*

9. **Approval Checkpoints**
   - “Awaiting Approval” status with approver attribution
   - Highlight overdue approvals

10. **Review Cadence (Monthly / Quarterly)**
    - Prompts: what moved / what didn’t / why
    - Rolling comparisons in dashboards

11. **Phase-Aware Signoff Workflow (Lightweight)**
    - Single approver, timestamp, note
    - Optional block on completion until signoff

---

## Phase 4 — Optional (Pull-Driven Only)
*Add only if adoption warrants.*

12. **Comment / Decision History**
13. **Light Notifications (Email / Teams)**
14. **Directory Assist (Owner Lookup)**

---

## Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)
- No extra hierarchy levels (keep Project → Solution → Component)
- No Agile jargon
- Avoid heavy customization; prefer conservative defaults

---

## Dashboard Build Order
1. Executive / Sponsor (exportable snapshot)
2. PM / Delivery cockpit
3. “My Items” panel
4. Governance / Audit feed (after change log)
