# Jira-lite Docs Map

- `project-overview.md`: product/tech goals, architecture, runtime layout, and dev quickstart.
- `api-documentation.md`: canonical API surface under `/api`, including CSV import/export, defaults, and error shapes.
- `data-model.md`: schema reference, enums, validation rules, and field semantics.
- `ui-overview.md`: UI flows, forms, behaviors, and how the frontend exercises the API.
- `project-core-principles-assessment.md`: delivery principles and quality guardrails.

Base URL (dev): `http://127.0.0.1:8000`; API lives under `/api` (health at `/health`), UI at `/`, interactive docs at `/docs` and `/redoc`.
